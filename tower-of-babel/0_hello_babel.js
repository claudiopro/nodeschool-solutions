# Introduction

This is the first exercise to learn ES6 using babel.

Even with the power of the latest version of node.js, it isn't possible right now to use all of the features from ES6.

To enable a lot of the new grammar, there is an additional package called babel which you can install using:

    $ npm install babel -g

Once you have done that, two new commands become available: babel and babel-node.
Let's starting by using babel-node.

Please create a program.js file that contains:

    console.log(`Hello Babel`);

Once you saved, it you will be able to run the program like this:

    $ babel-node program.js

Try to run it and make sure it shows Hello Babel.
*/

console.log(`Hello Babel`);
